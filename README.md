# Gesture Recognition Projects

This repository contains two gesture recognition systems developed using deep learning and computer vision techniques. Each project focuses on a different gesture-based communication method:

### ðŸ”¹ 1. [Sign Language Recognition](./sign-language-recognition)
Recognizes hand signs from Indian/American Sign Language using MediaPipe and transfer learning with a TensorFlow model.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. [Semaphore Sign Recognition](./semaphore-sign-recognition)
Recognizes semaphore flag signals representing 6 English alphabets using a custom-trained CNN on a self-created dataset.
